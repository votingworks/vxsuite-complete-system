The path we'll follow:

* create a proper virtual machine with appropriately sized partitions
* install Ubuntu baseline
* install all software
* set up users, directories, and permissions
* set up automatic login for the front-end user
* use CloneZilla to capture the image of this machine
* use CloneZilla to install on a physical machine
