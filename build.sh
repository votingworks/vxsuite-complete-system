# build.sh â€“ Build apps for testing or production.
#
# This script builds one or all of the VxSuite applications. It is used by
# setup-machine.sh when a machine becomes specialized and locked down.
#
# To keep the machine able to switch between apps for testing purposes, run:
#
#   ./build.sh all
#
# Then, you can run a specific app for testing like so:
#
#   ./run.sh mark
#
# This will leave the machine in an unlocked, unspecialized state suitable for
# testing out new builds/features/etc.
